- 👋 Hi, I’m @KevanV also know an KevansTech

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

I've always been interested in where digital meets the real world.  But I've not touched code in many years now.
Low level assembly code on 8bit computers.

Although I've taken courses and passed exams... I've never really got my head around OOP... it just doesn't nautrally fit in my brain.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

The plan is to work out how my DVB-T stick works... and see if I can get a signal out of it.

The steps as I see it today:
1. plug into XP and see if it works with the windows TV drivers.
2. Plug into Linux and see if it is reconised (at USB and driver level)
3. Search for data sheets for the main chips on the board
4. Search for similar projects
5. Break out the USB communication and see what we learn
6.

7. make a Radio with the DVB-T
8. make compatable with 1090
